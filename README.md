# Completion Website

## Intoduction

This website is ment to be used to see how far you have come in a video game, based on a checklist you fill out. 

## Background

The idea came from when I played the "Professor Oak Challange" in Pok√©mon Black 2 and I wanted to see how far I had come and how much was left until I was done. 

# TODO

* Make a mockup for the website.
* Create basic layout for the website.
* Create a database for holding progress and the checklists.
* Add a function to only view completed/incomplete tasks (I am thinking that I will do that with Vue).
* Function to add your own games to the website.
* Create a login function to seperate the progress for different users.

# Might Add

* A Laravel version of the website.
